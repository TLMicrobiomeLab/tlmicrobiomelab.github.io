# Translational Livestock Microbiome Research Lab (TLMRL)

This is the source code for the **Translational Livestock Microbiome Research Lab** website.

**Live Website:** [Translational Livestock Microbiome Research Lab](https://tlmicrobiomelab.github.io/)

## About the Lab
The TLMRL is dedicated to solving complex agricultural challenges through microbiome science. Our research integrates multi-omics data (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics) to decode host-microbe interactions in livestock species.

**Key Research Areas:**
* **Host-Microbe Interactions:** Ruminants and swine gut health.
* **Microbiome Therapeutics:** Probiotics, prebiotics, and early-life interventions.
* **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):** Mitigating resistance in livestock environments.
* **Sustainability:** Improving feed efficiency and reducing methane emissions.
